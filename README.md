# LowLevelPong

- School mainly taught me about low level programming concepts but I want to have a go at actually using real libraries for C++ and making something simple.


**Thoughts - CI/CD Related**

- There are some functions like TTF_OpenFont(parameters) which if they don't work means that there's fundamentally something wrong with the structure of my program. I could try running these functions as automated tests(GitHub Actions) everytime I pull changes to the main branch so that I can ensure my main branch code at least has basic functionality.

**Thoughts - Code Related**

- When I look at other people's C++ code, I notice that they avoid brackets for if statements if possible. This is wild coming from a C# job.


**Thoughts - Other**
- This is my first time using SDL2 so I found a guide online on how to get a window and renderer going.

-Initially wanted to use RayLib but my personal laptop is a Mac and the RayLib/MacOS 
integration is awful so SDL2 it is.
