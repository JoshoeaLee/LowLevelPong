# LowLevelPong

- Baby's first non-academic C++ project!
- Not really the most original idea, I want to use this as a start and then
try and make more retro games? 


**Thoughts**
- School mainly taught me about low level programming concepts but I want to have a go 
at actually using libraries for C++ and making something simple.

-Initially wanted to use RayLib but my personal laptop is a Mac and the RayLib/MacOS 
integration is awful so SDL2 it is.
